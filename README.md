# Solving-Systems-of-linear-equations-Root-Finder-
A numerical tool that compares and analyzes the behavior of the different numerical methods (such as Bisection, False-position, etc ) and two interpolation techniques (Newton â€“ Lagrange) 



calculate the root of an given equation using numerical
methods such that Bisection, False-position, Fixed point, Newton-Raphson, Secant and Bierge Vieta (GUI
program).
